		<h2>Chevrolet Corvette</h2>
		<p>The <strong>Chevrolet Corvette</strong>, known colloquially as the Vette, is a sports car manufactured by <a href="http://www.chevrolet.com/" target="_blank">Chevrolet</a>. The car has been produced through seven generations.[1][2] The first model, a convertible, was designed by Harley Earl and introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept show car. Myron Scott is credited for naming the car after the type of small, maneuverable warship called a corvette.[3] Originally built in Flint, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette is currently manufactured in Bowling Green, Kentucky and is the official sports car of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.</p>
		<p>The first generation Corvette was introduced late in the 1953 model year. Originally designed as a show car for the 1953 Motorama display at the New York Auto Show, it generated enough interest to induce GM to make a production version to sell to the public. First production was on June 30, 1953.</p>
	
		<p>This generation was often referred to as the "solid-axle" models (the independent rear suspension was not introduced until the second generation).[7] 300 hand-built 	polo white Corvette convertibles were produced for the 1953 model year</p>
	
		<p>A new body was introduced for the 1956 model featuring a new "face" and side coves; the taillamp fins were also gone.[9] An optional fuel injection system was made available in the middle of the 1957 model year. It was one of the first mass-produced engines in history to reach 1 bhp (0.75 kW) per cubic inch (16.4 cubic cm) and Chevrolet's advertising agency used a "one hp per cubic inch" slogan for advertising the 283 bhp (211 kW) 283 cu in (4.64 L) Small-Block engine.[10] Other options included power windows (1956), hydraulically operated power convertible top (1956), heavy duty brakes and suspension (1957), and four speed manual transmission (late 1957).[10] Delco Radio transistorized signal-seeking "hybrid" car radio, which used both vacuum tubes and transistors in its radio's circuitry (1956 option).</p>
